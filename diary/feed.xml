                        <p>Whats up! Its been a while! Ive been absolutely swamped with work and Ive dove headfirst into serverless functions, so thats why I havent made any diary entries lately!</p>
                        <p>Today Im gonna talk about my experience with one of my favorite games, webfishing!</p>
                        <!-- <div> -->

                                <p>If you dont already know, webfishing is a game where you fish. Thats basically it. You can catch all sorts of cool fish and play with your friends if you want!</p>
                                <!-- </div> -->
                                <p>The main appeal of this game is just vibing, I love getting my friends into a vc and just talking. Its a good game to give a group something to do, its a lot less demanding than playing most games! Really lets you chill and put the focus on chatting and getting to know people!</p>
                                <p>Anyways tahts it! I like this game! Ill try to make more of these short entries!</p>

                                                        <p>Hello! Been gone for like a month ish lol</p>
                                                        <p>I left around my midterms season, and then school picked up, and then finals wrapped up and my friends came back from uni... so yeah Ive been busy lol</p>
                                                                <p>Also trying to get a lot of certifications rn so yeah this site has been put on the backburner. But not forgotten!</p>
                                                                        <p>Honestly also I move across projects pretty quickly. Bought a pico and a few rpis from microcenter, my collection grows ever bigger. And a 3d printer. Ill be playing with those for a while! but I DO want to put more here so I will when I get more motivation</p>

                                                                <link href="https://asoik.dev/diary/CSelitism"/>
                                                                <updated>2024-10-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
                                                                <id>https://asoik.dev/diary/CSelitism</id>
                                                                <content type="html">
                                                                        <p>Hey! Im back, and today Im gonna talk about elitism, specifically in CS. Im really sick and tired of it so heres my take on it!</p>
                                                                        <p>Elitism is the assumed superiority of people that you think are less experienced than you. This comes in a variety of flavors, but its pretty obvious when people do it!</p>
                                                                        <p>I think CS has a ton of elitism! I dont really like the CS community because of this. Ego is a huge problem, unless you tell them your entire fucking resume they wont take you seriously lol.</p>
                                                                        <p>People make cs seem like a daunting and impossible task to get into, but its really not that hard after you learn how to learn (if that makes sense lol). Ive met the worst most diabolical people when I first started out, and I think I wouldve quit had it not been for the few down to earth people I met.</p>
                                                                        <p>Theres also so much micro-agression. Frequently people will say your code is dumb or that youre stupid for not knowing something, but also there are things like sarcastic responses or making fun of the things youre intrested in. For example making fun of your first language (js my goat) or making fun of your project that other people just dont understand (like making shitty websites or RSS feeds!). </p>
                                                                        <p>When you start out in this career/hobby I think its important to realise that communication skills are kind of lacking lol. Theres a reason why personality hires exist. This probably stems from everyone staying indoors and just doing their own thing, but also from just the nature and reward of programming. Theres a unique feeling when you FEEL like you understand something a lot, and a lot of people get trapped there because they like feeling better than the other 50% that havent gotten there yet.</p>
                                                                        <p>Especially when you start getting into real work, there will always be someone better than you. Mainly the grumpy senior dev that is like 50 years old who has a huge ego because he IS good, but still sucks to be around. Its kind of a toxic loop that causes the next person bellow this guy to take it out on the guy bellow, and so on.</p>
                                                                        <p>As someone who doesnt like this treatment, I think its important to try to dispell this toxic loop. We should always be open to other people learning, and be open to questions and mistakes. I find programming-help channels in discords to typically be super toxic lol, a lot of people expect those less experienced to just know everything. I know I got tricked by these communities before and it really put me down. People who inspired me and didnt treat me like I was stupid were what made me keep progressing, not the people calling me stupid for not knowing how npm worked.</p>
                                                                        <p>Imposter syndrome is a huge problem in CS and any computer field. There is endless knowledge, and we are all beginners in some field or another. No one has mastery over everything computers have to offer. I think its because of this that people are so elitist, they want to feel like they arent drowning in this sea of information and hold onto whatever they can to say they are knowledgeable. And I understand! Its cool feeling like youre at the top, but treating everyone bellow as stupid or not paying them respect as an equal in the field is ridiculous. What defines people in this space is passion, not knowledge.</p>
                                                                        <p>A lot of people forget where we all started, brain empty kids looking at vscode for the first time. Youre not unique, and anyone CAN be as skilled as you if they have the passion for it. Passion is important in this field, and we need more of it as a community. If we shun people without it, who will be your future coworkers?</p>

                                                                <link href="https://asoik.dev/diary/optimism"/>
                                                                <updated>2024-10-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
                                                                <id>https://asoik.dev/diary/optimism</id>
                                                                <content type="html">
                                                                        <p>I think optimism is pretty rare, at least in my generation. Optimism isnt something that inately came to me. In fact, I was depressed for most of my life until relatively recently, maybe 3 or 4 years ago. I dont think optimism CAN come inately, its something that you build up.</p>
                                                                        <p>Being optimistic doesnt mean you disregard facts. It means you choose to believe in the smaller chance of good. Let me explain!</p>
                                                                        <p>Lets say someone promises you something. Doesnt have to be big, just anything. Like that they will go with you to get ice cream. However, you KNOW that they will be busy, lets say they have a huge essay due that day. What do you do?</p>
                                                                        <p>Well most NORMAL people would just think "yeah no thats not happening" and either call it off or assume its not happening. Thats not opptimism!</p>
                                                                        <p>Now imagine it from an optimistic view. They promised you that they will come, so you SHOULD believe it! Trust in them that they will deliver! It isnt your job to filter out the bad, just do your best to believe in them! Even if they have this huge essay, what if they finish it fast for you? What if they take a break and go with you instead? What if they are going to try REALLY hard for you?</p>
                                                                        <p>Nowww look at it if they did come! How happy are you that your optimism paid off? I know I get incredibly happy when my trust in other people is rewarded. Theres something special about people defying their traditional expectations and meeting yours instead!</p>
                                                                        <p>Now I can already hear it. What happens when youre let down? What happens when they wont or cant fufill your expectations. Well, yes I will be a little sad and a little let down. However, youre lying if youre saying you WOUDLNT feel the same by assuming the worst. Assuming the worst only gets you one half of this, you might as well gamble it and possibly be suprised!</p>
                                                                        <p>Whats the point of being negative and not believing when you could and possibly get rewarded?</p>
                                                                        <p>I find that this mentality quenches a lot of my insecurities and pessimism. I will ALWAYS choose to believe in the brighter side, no matter how slim it is. I dont ignore facts and its not like I believe things will go perfectly if I dont put effort in, but as long as there is a chance Ill believe in it!</p>
                                                                        <p>Optimism isnt natural. We all have doubts. The world is a place where things are more likely to go bad than good. However, its ABOUT finding the good in the bad that makes life worth living. I will choose to believe that my friends like me, that my favorite show is good, that I will succeed in my career, even that people will read this diary entry!</p>
                                                                        <p>And I will KEEP believing in optimism, all the way until Im proven so wrong that I am forced to be anything less.</p>
                                                                        <p>This applies to so much! It gives me drive to keep practicing things, to validate my purchases, to turn bad interactions into understandable ones, and much more! What if I believe that people enjoy the art im putting out? What if I really enjoy this silly thing I found on amazon? What if the person I was talking to really does like to talk to me but just cant? What if they have trouble talking to people or are just going through something? These are all things that optimism questions and assumes positive answers for!</p>
                                                                        <p>Optimism does have its downsides. I DO get dissapointed sometimes, and I am proven wrong sometimes. However, at least with optimism I can stay happier for longer! Whats the point of admitting defeat before its over? Especially with optimism, the only way to know is to give it your very best all the way until the end. Live life with no regrets, thank you for reading! I plan on writing more about optimism in the future!

                                                                <link href="https://asoik.dev/diary/socialMedia"/>

                                                                <id>https://asoik.dev/diary/socialMedia</id>
                                                                <content type="html">
                                                                        <p>Warning! Rant! If you want a better first impression of me read my other post :(</p>
                                                                        <p>Wow! What an original topic! I promise I have an intresting take.</p>
                                                                        <p>Sooo I don't actually hate social media itself. I'm not intensely bothered by my metrics, nor am I bothered by the curated nature of it. I only ever post for my friends and myself, never for likes. In fact, on 99% of my insta posts I have my likes disabled. The comments are cooler!</p>
                                                                        <p>Social media is actually pretty fun to me, it makes it really easy to meet people and see their lives! Even if its unrealistic, I like being able to see into even a sliver of other people's lives and see where they are.</p>
                                                                        <p>Now, why did I say I hate social media? Why would I choose to make my own website to escape it? It seems like I like social media quite a bit, because I do.</p>
                                                                        <p>Well, it's kind of stupid but I HATE short form content.</p>
                                                                        <p>Dude I CANNOT STAND tiktok content. Not even the videos themselves, theyre fine. I like watching tiktoks and reels my friends send me. But thats where it ends. I am SICK of social media apps adding in tiktok. Tiktok itself, not that bad. I can just choose not to view it. Instagram??? Literally a permenant part of the bottom of my screen. Anytime I want to look at posts or stories they tempt you with the easiest dopamine and doom scroll ever. Even STORIES are just glorified tiktoks. If there was an otpion to remove reels from insta I would click it instantly.</p>
                                                                        <p>Even when my friends send me reels or tiktoks its already too much. I DONT want to be tempted, my self control is so bad and these multi-billion dollar companies know it. Its like a disease that forces you to take part in it just because your friends are too. If you have self control for this stuff thats great for you, but for me the ammount of time Ive wasted is incredible.</p>
                                                                        <p>But even this is fine. What really throws me off into the deep end is how actually STUPID people are. Not just misinformation, which is bad enough, but actual STUPID people. It's like where all the brain broken amoebas with barely a line of dna go to spout their takes. And the comments are worse. If I scroll for too long and look at the comments too many times Ill literally get dumber. People spreading false information, not doing ANY research at all, not showing a shred of critical thinking or empathy, and not ever being fact checked. I genuinely dont understand how these people are functioning members of society. Probably because they aren't.</p>
                                                                        <p>The doomscroll is bad. It really does make me lose hope in our world. I love being optimistic but how can I when I see someone genuinely believing the lies they say. Nothing makes me more sad than someone doing this who ratios someone else too. Like there are seriously more of you braindead worms than someone else with actual neurons?</p>
                                                                        <p>Anyways yeah. I hate short form content. I don't know what it is but it holds the dumbest most brain breaking people of all time, and gives me the worst doomscroll.</p>
                                                                        <p>I dont use tiktok or snapchat anymore, I try not to use instagram, and I basically only use twitter now. I gotta get my doomscroll once in a while, and its at least better than like instagram reels or something. Twitter is by no means smart, but I think the amount of smart and empathetic people outweigh the brainless amoebas. At least on twitter I can normally see where people are coming from. And the content is better! I get to see cool artists, which is WAY more rewarding than short form content.</p>
                                                                        <p>But yeah! Pretty ranty first post but hopefully this explains part of the reason I want to get away from social media.</p>

                                                                        <p>You may notice a few cool things! First is the tags, I plan on tagging all my diary entries. Using the tags you can search easily for certain topics!</p>
                                                                        <p>Secondly is the (hopefully) working rss feed! I don&#39;t really know how rss works just yet, and I plan on making a script to update the file for me, but I&#39;m super excited to use it!</p>
                                                                        <p>Some rules for myself with this diary:</p>
                                                                        <h2>Rules</h2>
                                                                        <p>Try to stay away from ssgs</p>
                                                                        <p>I know I want to post a lot a lot, and this will slow me down and MAYBE even kill my vibe, but I think if I have a choice I should put in extra effort. If I get super busy I&#39;ll start using an ssg, but if its not worth me manually making the page then it probably wasn&#39;t worth writing about.</p>
                                                                        <p>No restrictions</p>
                                                                        <p>I don&#39;t care who sees this. Only the purest of thoughts here! No other rules!</p>

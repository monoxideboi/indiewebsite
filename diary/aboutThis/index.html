                        <p>Hey! Its me! My exams finished up and I have a little downtime so I thought Id talk a little! <br><br>
                        To begin with, this website has kind of become larger than I thought it was.<br><br>
                        I dont really mean that in an actual like internet popularity way but a lot of people Ive met irl seem to really like it! I didnt really expect that and I always thought this would stay a small private project no one would care about.<br><br>
                        Whats especially suprising is that people in the CS space seem to really like my website, despite it being super super duper basic and non-technical. I guess my website's theme attracts people? I think Ive made more connections from this on my discord profile than my actual portfolio at this point.<br><br>
                        And Im especially thankful! Im super glad other people think my stuff is cool :D

                        <p>Anyways heres some actual news into my life: Ive been doing a lot recently!<br><br>
                        I recently picked up the Slay the Spire Board Game; and its been the MOST fun Ive had playing a game for a while. Its basically a coop 4 person roguelike deckbuilding game where you take on fantasy monsters while climbing a spire. Ill probably write a review of it at some point!<br><br>
                        Aside from that, Ive been diving deeper into the cybersecurity rabbit hole. Lots of planning for certs and entering competitions, Ill post here if I do something noteworth that wont doxx me!

                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
                        <p>This websites been pretty abandoned for some time, so I think while Ive got time Ill work on some stuff.<br><br>
                        I think I want to incorporate rating music into my website, I have a solution I want to make with a dedicated page and catalogue but Ill see how that goes when I make it!<br><br>
                        I might also want to incorporate food reviews too.. well see! Stay tuned!

                        <p>Alsooo... I started and finished apothecary diaries! Awesome show, nothing crazy insane but definitely something that I can say I watched. Just thought Id throw it in the end!
